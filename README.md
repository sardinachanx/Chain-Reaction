# Chain Reaction
Random offline Chain Reaction game written in Java, inspired by [Yvo Schaap](http://yvoschaap.com/chainrxn/).  Currently under development.

##Current Features
- Three game modes: Original, Infinite, Survival
  - Original: Adopted from Yvo Schaap's [advanced version](http://yvoschaap.com/chainrxnadvanced/) with 12 levels, unlimited lives
  - Infinite: Level threshold unknown, high difficulty, unlimited lives
  - Survival: Level threshold known, medium-low difficulty, 1 life only!
- Therapeutic (maybe) music for each game mode


##Game Instructions
Click anywhere to land and expand the bomb. When a ball collides with a bomb or any ball that has hit the bomb, the ball also explodes. You pass the level if enough balls expand. The further the ball is from the bomb, the higher the score.

*Original & Survival Only:* 
*If you don't pass the level threshold, the amount of lives you use increases by 1. Your final high score depends on how many lives you use, so be careful!*


##Features in progress
- Highscore records & table
- Easter Eggs!
